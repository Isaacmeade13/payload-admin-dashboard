1. **Workflow Trigger:** The workflow is manually triggered using `workflow_dispatch`.  It prompts the user to select the target environment (preview or production) via an input field.

2. **Environment Variables:** The workflow uses repository secrets for `VERCEL_TOKEN` and repository variables for `VERCEL_ORG_ID` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`.  The selected environment (preview or production) is also set as the workflow's environment.

3. **Checkout Code:** The `actions/checkout@v2` action checks out the project's code.

4. **Install Vercel CLI:** Installs the Vercel CLI using npm.

5**Install Project Dependencies:** Installs the project's npm dependencies.

6**Pull Vercel Environment Information:**  Uses `vercel pull` to synchronize the local project with the specified Vercel environment.  This likely pulls environment variables and other configuration specific to the target environment.

7**Copy Environment File:** Copies the appropriate environment file (`.vercel/.env.preview.local` or `.vercel/.env.production.local`) to `.env` in the project root.  This makes the environment variables available during the build process.

8**Build Project Artifacts:** Builds the project using `vercel build`.  The `--prod` flag is added if the target environment is production.

9**Deploy to Vercel:** Deploys the pre-built artifacts to Vercel using `vercel deploy --prebuilt`.  The `--prod` flag is used for production deployments.

10**Database Migration (Post-Deployment):** After successful deployment, runs `npm run migrate` to execute database migrations. This step assumes a database migration script is defined in the project's `package.json`.
